## Spenser's page

I'm an Electrical engineering student who likes to code.

I put a project I've started work on last summer, which is a [DND character creation program](https://github.com/spenserMcGaughey/dndcharactermaker).

It's a character creation program for the popular RPG Dungeons and Dragons (5e).
